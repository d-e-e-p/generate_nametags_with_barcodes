# generate_nametags_with_barcodes

 
 every year an elementary school in california runs a festival where families 
 sign up for parties and events, as well as bid for auctions and donations.
 each family is issued some stickers with unique barcode to make it easier 
 to sign up.

 i couldn't figure out how to get avery on-line mailmerge to do all i wanted
 (scale fonts to fit, skip missing parent's names, repeat labels etc)
 so here we are.

### prereq:

>
>  pip install reportlab
>
>  pip install openpyxl
>
>  pip install pylabels

 code is written to be thrown away after it's first successful run :-)
